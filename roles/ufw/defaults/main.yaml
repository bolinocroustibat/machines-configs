# UFW rules per host
# SSH is configured in install.yaml to ensure it's opened first
# Each rule should have: port, proto (default: tcp), and comment
# Example:
# ufw_rules:
#   - { port: http, proto: tcp, comment: "Allow HTTP traffic for web servers" }
#   - { port: https, proto: tcp, comment: "Allow HTTPS traffic for secure web servers" }
#   - { port: 9091, proto: tcp, comment: "Allow Transmission web interface" }
